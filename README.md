# Chandrayaan-3 Lunar Spacecraft Control

## Overview

This project implements a program to control the Chandrayaan-3 lunar spacecraft using galactic coordinates. The spacecraft is capable of moving forward/backward, turning left/right, and turning up/down. The development of this program follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Problem Statement

As a scientist at ISRO controlling the latest lunar spacecraft Chandrayaan 3, the task is to develop a program that translates commands sent from Earth into instructions understood by the spacecraft. The spacecraft navigates through the galaxy using galactic coordinates (x, y, z) and follows specific rules for movement and rotation.

## Requirements

- Ruby Version: 3.0.2
- Rails Version: 7.1.3

## Getting Started

To run the program locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/Sausheelya/Chandrayaan-3-Updated-Version.git]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Chandrayaan-3-Updated-Version`
3. Install dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Run the Rails server: `rails server`
5. Access the application in your browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Development Process

The development of this project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Each functionality and test case was implemented incrementally, and the code was committed at every stage to showcase the evolution of the codebase.

## Folder Structure

- **app/controllers:** Contains the Spacecraft controller responsible for executing commands.
- **spec/requests:** Houses the test cases for the Spacecraft controller.

## Test Cases

Test cases have been written to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the spacecraft control program. Each test case is associated with a specific functionality and has been committed separately to provide a clear history of the development process.
